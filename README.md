# Module 3 - Javascript - Employee-Payroll-Page

## Description
This is the Javascript Challenge. Making an employee payroll page using Javascript. The challenge was to be able to use window prompts to enter information that would be stored as variables/objects/arrays, and then be able to use that information to get an average salary. We also got to use the math random ability!

Below are screenshots to see the final product:

## Usage
This website can be used to view my bio, 5 pieces of work, and some contact information. This can be used in the future for potential employers or co-workers. 

For now, not all of the "Work" items are coding related, but by the end of the course I'm sure they will be.
